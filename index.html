    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would in most cases advise the client to have a dedicated security team if possible. They should also consider using continuous deployment because it keeps the code up to speed and on its toes so to speak. I also think its important to try to stay ahead of the problem which is often best achieved by understanding it, so i would recomend to execute mock attacks to actually test ones web security in house. Keep the site updated at all times, take use of security frameworks and firewalls. Login timeouts, two factor authentifications and password resets should also be considered depending on the sensitivity of the information on the site.Â  </p>
